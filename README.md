*Simple GTK WebKit browser interface*

This is a lightweight, header-based simple web browser built using **WebKitGTK** — the same rendering engine used by Safari — combined with the **GTK** GUI library, primarily designed for GNOME/Linux environments.

- **Single-tab browser** with basic navigation: back, forward, refresh, and URL entry.
- Built entirely with header-based code for simplicity and ease of understanding.
- Uses the powerful WebKit rendering engine for reliable and modern webpage rendering.
- Designed for learning and experimenting with GTK and WebKit integration.
